# ðŸ§© Agent NFT

## Overview

Eliza's Agent NFT is a unique identifier for each agent, which is stored on the 0G blockchain. The NFT contains the agent's ownership and private data. The NFT can be transferred, cloned, and authorized to other agents following the 0G [ERC-7857](https://github.com/0glabs/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7857.md) standard.

## Core Components

The core component of the Agent NFT is the `AgentNFTClient` class, which is used to interact with the Agent NFT smart contract deployed on the 0G network. It provides methods to generate new agent NFTs from local agent data, and start a new agent from an existing NFT.

### Generate Agent NFT

When generating a new agent NFT:
   - The agent's character data and memory (SQLite database) are stored in a specified base directory.
   - The agent data are uploaded to the 0G storage network using the `Indexer`.
   - Merkle trees are generated for the character data and memory, and the root hashes are obtained.
   - Ownership proofs are generated using the preimages and claimed hashes (TODO: implement actual proof generation).
   - The `mintToken` method is called on the Agent NFT contract, passing the proofs and data descriptions.
   - The newly minted token ID is returned.

### Start Agent from NFT

When starting an agent from an existing NFT:
   - The `loadFromNFT` function is called with the token ID and base directory when select starting an agent from an existing NFT.
   - The token data (owner, data hashes, data descriptions, authorized users) is fetched from the contract.
   - Token ownership is validated by comparing the claimed owner with the actual token owner.
   - The agent data files are downloaded from the 0G storage network using the `Indexer` and the data hashes and saved in the `AgentMetadata`.
   - The agent started with `AgentMetadata` like previous starting with a local agent (character data and memory).

## Configuration

The following environment variables are required:

- `ZEROG_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the 0G network.
- `ZEROG_INDEXER_RPC_URL`: The Indexer RPC URL for the 0G network.
- `ZEROG_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the agent owner.
- `ZEROG_AGENT_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the Agent NFT contract.

## Usage

### Generating an Agent NFT

To generate a new agent NFT, run the `generate-nft` script:

```bash
pnpm generate-nft --dir="./data"
```

This will download the agent data associated with the specified token ID, save it in the `--dir`, and return the loaded characters.

### Starting an Agent from an Existing NFT

To start an agent from an existing NFT, run the `start` script with the parameter `--token`, which is the token ID of the NFT, and the parameter `--dir` is the base directory to store the agent data, if not specified, the data will be stored in a unique directory generated by the token ID.

```bash
pnpm start --token="1" --dir="./data"
```

This will download the agent data associated with the specified token ID, save it in the `--dir`, and start the agent with the saved agent data.
